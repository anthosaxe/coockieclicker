### steps:

- Variables for points, credit, click the variables are assigned to <tag>.textcontext , if the values are 0 show nothing.

- have a button when clicked will add 1 point to points and credit

​	When button(coockie) clicked Function (){ points++; credit++}

- Have multiplier buttons that show the amoute it will multipy and with price disable by default

- Have a veriable for (amoutofmultipler), in start check if the amoutofmultipler ==  0 it will run the funtion and increes the value of (amoutofmultipler) and have a elseif check if the value is bigger the 0 run the function and multipy the (multipyer price) with (amoutofmultipler) ***\*step8\****

-  Check if the value of the credit if its same or more then price of multiplier the specific multiply button will active(remove the disable for button) and minis the value of credit

​	If(credit >= (a multipier price))

​		The multipier button remove disable

​		Credit - multipier price

-  Multiple: when specific button clicked and the value assiged to the click variable.

​	```Function click+=multipy(2x).value;```

 ***\*Step10\**** Auto-clicker : Check if the credit is enough for the price of clicker and if its clicked it will get the credit and points and add 1 to it for x amount of second 

​		Make a loop with counter value amount of seconds and add 1 to credit and points
